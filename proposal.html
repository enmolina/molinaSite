					<h1>Letter of Intent</h1>
						<p>
						My motivation for this project stems from my interest in and enthusiasm for live music festivals and concerts, 
						which I have been frequently attending for over five years. I intend to not only celebrate the uniqueness of 
						the music festival experience through this project, but to also provide access to all music-lovers, whether 
						they are new to or already experienced in the scene. The underlying goal for this project is therefore to deliver 
						an outlet for all music-lovers who are hesitant or unable to attend a music festival of interest. Personally, I 
						have missed out on many events due to financial restraints associated with ticket prices, travel, accommodation 
						and so forth. In such cases, I take to the festival website to watch a live stream of the event, which although 
						does not compare to the live experience itself, may be the second best thing. The finished product will therefore 
						allow individuals stuck in this same situation to experience their favorite festivals through both the audio and 
						visual components so unique to the culture. The site may also act as an annual festival calendar that users can 
						browse to learn more about new events that may interest them in the future through photos, videos, descriptions 
						and user reviews. The website design will reflect the music festival experience as closely as possible, with 
						vivid imagery, bright photos and various audiovisual components. 
					<h1>Theme & Subject</h1>
						<p>
						My project will act as a "digital hub" of all live streams, virtual tours, videos, photos and other relevant 
						media from all major music festivals across the globe. 
					<h1>Scope</h1>
						<p>
						This project will incorporate all forms of rich media with a heavy focus on video and audio for the festival recap 
						videos and live streams. Images will be used primarily for festival photo galleries and 360-degree virtual tours of 
						festival grounds. Several APIs may also be used, including YouTube for video, Google Maps for festival locations, 
						Pandora (or something similar) for suggested events, and Yelp for user reviews.<br><br>
						Interactivity will be highlighted throughout the site, not only when users engage with live streams, but also when 
						they leave personal reviews about their favorite events. I also hope to incorporate a suggestions feature that 
						recommends specific festivals to users based on their interests (Facebook likes, Spotify playlists, etc.) and 
						favorite festivals.
					<h1>Design</h1>
						<p>
						In Donald Norman's discussion on emotional design, he claims that everything has a personality, including web design. 
						This is clearly evident in sites associated with music festivals, which are each designed to convey the "personality" 
						of that specific festival. Coachella, for example, conveys a laidback, "chill" vibe where as Ultra Music Festival is 
						highlighted by bright lights, loud noise and high energy. <br><br>
						I must therefore consider the unique personalities of each festival in my own design. Should I focus on one uniform, 
						consistent design throughout the website? Or should I design each page differently based on the festival's 
						personality? I expect this to be one of my biggest challenges to address in my design.
