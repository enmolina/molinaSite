					The two articles chosen for discussion this week focus on the idea that the Web is "dead," or is at 
					least on a decline after about two decades of existence. The <i>Wired Magazine</i> article attributes this 
					demise to the introduction of mobile devices, tablets and their relative applications. Not only do 
					consumers prefer to access information from apps on their mobile devices, but businesses too have 
					shifted their marketing efforts from the Web to mobile. During my summer internship at PwC, for example, 
					I experienced firsthand the concept of "mobile first" in software development. Any time my team was 
					required to design and sketch up wireframes for a new feature or web page, we designed the mobile 
					wireframe first, and then used that to build out the more complex desktop design. PwC is only one of 
					many firms designing by these standards, which focus on enhancing the user experience on the mobile web, 
					which is evidently used more frequently than the desktop web.
					<br><br>

					Despite the rise of mobile, the web is certainly not dead. The 2010 <i>Wired Magazine</i> article claims 
					that the need for the web as a digital presence and a source of information is declining, as the rise 
					of mobile apps and tablets replace the original methods of information sharing and media consumption. 
					Although it is valid to say that people are accessing digital information from their mobile devices and 
					tablets more frequently than they did five years ago, it is unreasonable to assume that this new digital 
					trend has completely "killed" the web.
					</p>
					<br><br>

					Five years after this article published, the web continues to be one of the primary sources of information 
					worldwide. Apps are indeed the preferable method of information retrieval for many consumers, who prefer 
					when "the screen comes to them, they don't have to go to the screen." We must also consider, however, 
					whether these mobile apps are in fact helping or hurting the web. In many cases, apps are a gateway to 
					the web. Any link that is opened from major apps like Facebook and Twitter, for example, link directly to 
					mobile friendly web pages. Although people are spending less time accessing the web on their desktop 
					computers, they are accessing the web nonetheless. More time on their mobile phones just means people are 
					changing the ways in which they access the web.

					An <u><a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/02/web-dead/" target="_blank">article</a></u> published in 2014 (ironically, 
					by <i>Wired Magazine</i> as well) supports the idea that the rise of mobile has only allowed the web to continue 
					its growth. The article lists numerous statistics that show an increase in web usage on both mobile and 
					desktop; perhaps the most significant figure, however, is the fact that the amount of data on the web is 
					expected to more than double in the next three years. Similarly, the amount of data on the mobile web is 
					expected to increase by more than 10 times its current size. The article comes to an end by admitting 
					these facts and figures as "a clear indication of growth," rather than signs of a "dying entity." After 
					all, if I truly thought the web was dead or near death, I wouldnâ€™t be spending my Fridays in a course 
					called "Creative Coding for the Web."
