					YouTube has thousands of "virtual scenery" videos targeted toward runners on treadmills, particularly those who 
					get bored easily during their cardio. I speak from experience and will shamefully admit that I gave 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=virtual+scenery+treadmill" target="blank"><u>these videos</u></a> 
					a chance when I first started running. Although the videos gave me something to look at while I ran for 30+ minutes 
					on the treadmill, in no way did they help keep my mind off the unbearably slow clock or the leftover Chipotle bowl 
					waiting for me at home. Eventually, I moved on to episodes of Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy, which undoubtedly 
					kept me running, perhaps out of fear. But if entertainment platforms like YouTube or Netflix eventually incorporate 
					VR video services, I guarantee runners like me (and maybe even cyclists/spinners) would invest in VR scenic trails 
					and routes.
					<br><br>
					The first major consideration for such a proposal would be the size, weight and comfort of the technology. 
					The current models of most VR headsets are too bulky for a comfortable run, and would need to consider aerodynamics 
					and lightness.  
					<br><br>
					Secondly, the VR experience should include more than just scenery. To maximize the benefits throughout the run, 
					the technology should also track heart rate, speed, distance and other relevant figures, and display them on the 
					screen, within the runner's view.  
					<br><br>
					Finally, integration with a music streaming service like Spotify would be ideal to make the experience enjoyable and fun. 
					The Nike Running app, for example, selects and plays songs from a set playlist based on the speed of the user's running 
					and heart rate. Similarly, this VR simulation would play suggested songs for the runner based on his or her numbers. 
					Users should of course, also have the ability to choose the music themselves. All these features should, 
					however, keep the runner entertained, engaged and excited to run.
