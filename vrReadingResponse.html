					The topic of virtual reality has always been of interest to me, as is the case with many people, 
					given its promising potential to blur the lines between tangible and virtual reality. The Verge 
					article draws parallels between VR’s “metaphysical transportation to an altered state” and the 
					“escapism” offered by drugs, alcohol and sex. Such a concept never really crossed my mind, and it 
					raises the question of whether VR technology brings with it any negative implications involving overuse 
					or dependencies. 
					<br><br>
					<p>
					To date, however, I still believe VR is in its earliest stages and must be explored further 
					before being widely adopted. The interview with Brandon Jones from Google highlights an important 
					consideration for virtual reality; “the act of putting on and taking off a VR headset,” he says, is 
					“an essentially destructive activity.” There is no question that VR holds potential for the gaming 
					community, however the functionality of VR technology is still too bulky and destructive to integrate 
					seamlessly with actual reality. This also begs the question of the validity of the term “augmented reality.” 
					Is VR really taking reality and amplifying and improving it? With the exception of VR gaming experiences – 
					which I have yet to experience but can imagine it being an immersive experience – VR fails to offer an 
					experience better than the real thing. 
					</p>

					This exploration of augmented reality is the focus of my thesis project, which is why I really enjoyed 
					dissecting these readings and gaining insights from experienced professionals with different opinions 
					on the matter. Personally, I am interested in the use of VR technology specifically at music festivals 
					and concerts. As an avid concertgoer myself, I would love the opportunity to experience and “relive” 
					the shows I’ve been to through virtual reality. I have a nostalgic soul when it comes to music, and 
					the ability to “transport back” to my favorite concert moments would be truly special. Similarly, I 
					would find great value in experiencing a music festival I could not attend via virtual reality. To me, 
					that would be the second best thing. 
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
					While similar ideas are floating around today, like the real estate walkthrough example mentioned in 
					Jones’ interview, VR still needs improvements on the functionality and integration of its hardware to offer 
					more immersive environments to users.
