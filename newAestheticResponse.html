					Given my unfamiliarity with the New Aesthetic prior to this reading assignment, I spent 
					a couple of hours exploring the concept and the numerous blogs, articles and online forums 
					discussing the topic. Initially, I perceived the New Aesthetic as a "no brainer." I thought 
					to myself, <i>Is this really news? Doesn't everybody know this exists?</i> The New Aesthetic, to me, 
					was just a term that refers to the blurring lines between real and digital or physical and virtual. 
					<br><br>
					<p>
					But Sterling's article highlights the exact importance of reintroducing this popular concept to 
					mainstream culture. He is pushing the New Aesthetic to grow and develop those aspects that he himself 
					claims it lacks. Although constructive, comprehensible and contemporary, the New Aesthetic lacks credibility 
					and purpose. Sterling says the main problem with this "gaudy, network-assembled heap" is the fact that it is 
					indeed new. This issue is similar to a typical generation gap; it is a traditional story about a "cluster of 
					creative people who are perceiving important stuff that other, older, and dumber people don't get quite yet." 
					There is no doubt that the New Aesthetic exists, but its potential for growth depends on its ability to engage 
					and comprehend the meaning behind these computer-generated images. 
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>
					Simply put, Sterling shows the New Aesthetic some tough love by offering both praise and criticism for its 
					progress - or lack thereof - to date, and consequently encourages anyone involved in the movement to start 
					asking questions and find purpose in exploring it further.  He concludes his rant of an article by claiming 
					that "something profound ha[s] been touched. Touched, although not yet grasped." Ironically enough, Sterling's 
					article sparked interest and had people talking, further pushing the New Aesthetic one step closer to being 
					grasped and understood by both its founders and mainstream culture altogether.
